          <h2>Rooted in Resilience</h2>
          <p>When I moved away from Asheville to the Chapel Hill/Carrboro area, I suffered fom homesickness and found myself wishing for more green in my living space. This was when I first started collecting plants!</p>
          <p>The aesthetic of the "living art” was calming. I loved having something to care for and nurture; the practice of meeting each plants’ finicky needs became a meditative and healing experience as I was also learning how to care for myself as a young adult. The energy and effort that I put into my plants were rewarded by growth, even when I neglected them for a while. </p>
          <p>To this day, I am inspired by my house plants and their hardiness and they remind me to cultivate grit and resilience myself.</p>
